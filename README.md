# Welcome to My GitHub Repository!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tareq Hasan a Computer Science and Engineering student at East Delta University in Chattogram, Bangladesh.

## Academic Background

In the journey so far, I've gained a solid understanding of various languages and technologies. Here's a brief overview:

- **Languages:** I've worked with the classics like C and C++, explored the realms of Java, Python, HTML, and CSS; delved into the world of Assembly language, and danced with databases using MySQL.

- **Concepts:** I've wrapped my head around Object-Oriented Programming, so now inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism are like old friends. Database management is another area I've mastered, handling data like a pro.

- **Operating Systems:** Basic operations on an operating system? Yep, I got that covered too!

## Project: 
1. Web Devloment Project: Nextgenjob

I have played my role as the lead UI designer and advisor for a web development project named **Nextgenjob**. It's a job listing website where I have contributed to the user interface design and provided guidance on various aspects of the project.

2. IoT Project: HeatSync
   
I came up with the idea to build  an IoT system to monitor the room temperature and adjust the fan speed according to the temperature. This can be controlled and monitored by phone or computer from anywhere in the world with the internet. It was my responsibility to modify the ESP32 for the project and perform everything according to the plan.

3. ML Project: Spam Email Detection
It was an individual project where I chose to build a system that can classify emails as spam and ham using a Machine Learning Algorithm.

4. Neural Network Project: Spam Email Detection
It was the same as the ML project, but I used the Neural Network model instead of Machine Learning here.
