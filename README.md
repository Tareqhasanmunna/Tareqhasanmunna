# Welcome to My GitHub Repository!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tareq Hasan a Computer Science and Engineering student at East Delta University in Chattogram, Bangladesh. Currently cruising through my 6th semester, I've been diving into programming and soaking up knowledge like a sponge.

## Academic Background

In the journey so far, I've gained a solid understanding of a variety of languages and technologies. Here's a brief overview:

- **Languages:** I've worked with the classics like C and C++, explored the realms of Java, delved into the world of Assembly language, and danced with databases using MySQL.

- **Concepts:** I've wrapped my head around Object-Oriented Programming, so now inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism are like old friends. Database management is another area I've mastered, handling data like a pro.

- **Operating Systems:** Basic operations on an operating system? Yep, I got that covered too!

## Current Project: Nextgenjob

I'm currently wearing multiple hats as the main UI designer and advisor for a web development project named **Nextgenjob**. It's a job listing website where I'm contributing to the user interface design and providing guidance on various aspects of the project.

## What You'll Find Here

This GitHub repository is a collection of my projects, experiments, and the code I've written along the way. Feel free to explore and share your thoughts!
