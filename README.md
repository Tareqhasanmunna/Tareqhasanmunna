# Welcome to My GitHub Repository!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tareq Hasan a Computer Science and Engineering student at East Delta University in Chattogram, Bangladesh. Currently cruising through my 6th semester, I've been diving into programming and soaking up knowledge like a sponge.

## Academic Background

In the journey so far, I've gained a solid understanding of various languages and technologies. Here's a brief overview:

- **Languages:** I've worked with the classics like C and C++, explored the realms of Java, delved into the world of Assembly language, and danced with databases using MySQL.

- **Concepts:** I've wrapped my head around Object-Oriented Programming, so now inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism are like old friends. Database management is another area I've mastered, handling data like a pro.

- **Operating Systems:** Basic operations on an operating system? Yep, I got that covered too!

## Project: Nextgenjob

I have played my role as the lead UI designer and advisor for a web development project named **Nextgenjob**. It's a job listing website where I have contributed to the user interface design and provided guidance on various aspects of the project.

## What You'll Find Here

This GitHub repository is a collection of my projects, experiments, and the code I've written. Feel free to explore and share your thoughts!


## Get in Touch

I'm always open to collaboration, learning new things, and connecting with fellow enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions or want to chat about tech or programming. You can drop me an email at tareqprofessional@gmail.com.

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! ðŸš€
